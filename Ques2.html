        Cookies and Sessions are used to store information. Cookies are only
        stored on the client-side machine, while sessions get stored on the
        client as well as a server.

      Session

      <p>
        A session creates a file in a temporary directory on the server where
        registered session variables and their values are stored. This data will
        be available to all pages on the site during that visit. A session ends
        when the user closes the browser or after leaving the site, the server
        will terminate the session after a predetermined period of time,
        commonly 30 minutes duration.
      </p>

      Cookies

        of use tracking purpose. Server script sends a set of cookies to the
        browser. For example name, age, or identification number etc. The
        browser stores this information on a local machine for future use. When
        next time browser sends any request to web server then it sends those
        cookies information to the server and server uses that information to
        identify the user.
