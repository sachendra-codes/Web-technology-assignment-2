      <p>
        An XML parser is a software library or package that provides interfaces
        for client applications to work with an XML document. The XML Parser is
        designed to read the XML and create a way for programs to use XML.
      </p>
      Advantages It supports both read and write operations and the API is very
      simple to use.<br />
      It is preferred when random access to widely separated parts of a document
      is required.<br />
      Disadvantages It is memory inefficient. (consumes more memory because the
      whole XML document needs to loaded into memory).<br />
      It is comparatively slower than other parsers.<br />
