      HTML frames allow authors to present documents in multiple views, which
      may be independent windows or subwindows. Multiple views offer designers a
      way to keep certain information visible, while other views are scrolled or
      replaced. For example, within the same window, one frame might display a
      static banner, a second a navigation menu, and a third the main document
      that can be scrolled through or replaced by navigating in the second
      frame.
      <p>
        By using frames, you can break up the Web page into distinct regions and
        show a different HTML file in each. With this arrangement, one region
        can switch to another page while other regions remain the same. For
        instance, a page containing an advertising banner or a navigational menu
        (similar to a book's table of contents) can remain visible in one part
        of the browser window while the user jumps between pages in the site in
        another part of the window. Frames can be a tremendously valuable layout
        tool, but they can also present a variety of problems.p>
